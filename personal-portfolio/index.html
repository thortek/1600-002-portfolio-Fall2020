            <h4>React</h4>
            <p>I think React is something I will definitely want to use in the future.  It used to be somewhat difficult to use because there was some complexity around either class-based or functional components.  This has all been fixed by a new approach known as "React Hooks".  This makes it much easier to use React than it used to be.  I also like VueJS quite a bit because it is so easy to use, but React skills will also cross over to mobile development using React Native.</p>
